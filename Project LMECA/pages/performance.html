                <h1>Algorithm's Performance</h1>
                <p>
                    To access the code performance, we conducted tests to determine how long the code takes to run considering different numbers of points. Initially, 
                    we generated 6 files with random points ranging in size from 10 to 1000000 points. The code showing how the time was calculated can be viewed in the 
                    "performance.html" file. The table summarizes the results obtained.
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    Initially, we were a bit surprised by the result, as the flipping edges is an algorithm with O(n^2) complexity, while Bowyer-Watson is a more optimized 
                    algorithm that can even have O(n^2) complexity depending on how it was implemented but can achieve O(nlogn) complexity. We then tried to run the tests 
                    again by removing the use of the algorithm to find the convex hull (which also has theoretical O(nlogn) complexity), but still, we achieved the same 
                    results. Therefore, we formulated two hypotheses:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>H1:</b> The implemented Bowyer-Watson algorithm is not optimized enough and is performing close to O(n^2) complexity.</li>
                    <li><b>H2:</b> The calculation of this time is strongly influenced by the browser, and therefore, the code reaches TimeOut for n > 100000, making inferences about its complexity impossible.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    To test these hypotheses, we downloaded libraries that claim to be highly performant and optimized from GitHub, such as "delaunator". Their runtime is 
                    calculated for distributions with more than 100 thousand points.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../images/performance2.jpg" alt="Performance" width="500" height="auto">
                </figure>
                <p>
                    However, even with these libraries, we were unable to make the browser run meshes with more than 100 thousand points, only smaller meshes. Therefore, 
                    we reached the conclusion that H2 might be true, and the best way to test the code would be using Node, for example. Due to this limitation, we did not 
                    continue with the tests, and thus, H1 remains open.
